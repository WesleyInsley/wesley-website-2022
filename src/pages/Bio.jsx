            <h4>What's My Story?</h4>
            {/* COVER LETTER/BIO, more like a personal cover letter */}
            <p>
                Born in a small town in Virginia, I was two months premature with a hole in my heart (still have the scar to prove it, too).
                I was a scene skater kid who liked jumping off of rooftops and climbing buildings I probably shouldn't have. 
            </p>

                Fast forward to 2011 and I'm creating silly content on YouTube with my friends. While we maybe made $20 total off of adsense, 
                we did license quite a few clips for a couple hundred bucks each to content aggregators like JukinMedia and Break.com. Towards 
                the end of my 11th grade year I was contacted by a local talent agent and my entertainment career began.

            <p>
                I found myself on various tv shows for Fox, Investigation Discovery, REELZ, and even AMC. Eventually I booked three weeks on the feature
                film <i>Field of Lost Shoes</i>, directed by Sean McNamara (Disney's "That's So Raven" and "Even Stevens"). This is where I met the
                 Emmy award winning director Kevin Hershberger, who at that time was heading the wardrobe department. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Under Kevin's lead, I cut my teeth editing in a professional setting, editing four docuseries that are now on Amazon Prime. I continued
                to edit for various freelance clients before I decided to step into the producer role. My first video I produced was a music video for 
                Jim O'Farrell, who I had also met on Field of Lost Shoes. Since then I have produced music videos for over 100 bands and brands, including
                Emmy award winning bands.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a decade of experience, I finally moved to Brooklyn, New York, where I found a job under former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey. I 
                worked at his non-profit New Jersey Reentry Corporation as his Creative Director, leading a team of graphic designers and social media managers.
            </p>
            <p><b>But what about tech?</b> I'm glad you asked. I have two passions in my life - entertainment, and technology. I built my first computer in 2007,
            and programmed my first "Hello World" in java the same year. While most of my time was spent helping my friends with their MySpace pages, I fell in love
            with programming and web development. Since then I have created websites for various brands around my hometown. Starting with WordPress, I branched out and 
            started building sites from scratch. I spend most of my free time learning more about the latest Javascript frameworks - mostly React.
            </p>
            <p>For a kid who had a very small chance of surviving birth, I'd like to think I've done alright for myself...and hey! I'm not stopping anytime soon. Who knows
                where my journey will lead me. Maybe you'll see me on your TV again. Maybe I'll be working right along with you at your company. Maybe I'll become an astronaut!
                ...Okay, that last one might be out of the cards, but I think I've got a good shot at the first two.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn about me, I hope you have a great day. -W</p>
